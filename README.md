# WASSUP-WASM
"WASSUP-WASM" is a tiny application that can be used to download and execute the WebAssembly binary using Node.JS.

Note:
The JavaScript file generated by this tool executes the C/C++ code present inside the main(). In order to call the functions from JavaScript use "-s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS" while compiling your C/C++ program and replave the base64 string with the newly generated JS file.
